# Helios RTB Engine - Execution Plan

> **Quick Start**: For complete setup instructions, see [COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md](../COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

This document outlines the development workflow and execution strategy for building the Helios RTB Engine. It's designed for both individual developers and teams.

---

## Overview

The Helios project is built incrementally in phases, with each phase adding functionality while maintaining a working system. This approach:
- ✅ Reduces debugging complexity
- ✅ Enables early testing and validation
- ✅ Allows for incremental learning
- ✅ Provides clear milestones

## Phase A: Initial Setup - "Getting Ready"

**Objective**: Prepare your development environment before writing any application code.

### Step 1: System Prerequisites

Install required software (see [COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md Section 1](../COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md#1-prerequisites)):

1. **WSL2** - `wsl --install` in PowerShell (Administrator)
2. **Docker Desktop** - Enable WSL2 integration
3. **Git** - For version control
4. **Essential tools** - curl, jq in WSL

**Verification**:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
wsl --version
```

### Step 2: Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jigarbhoye04/devops.git
cd devops

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup.sh test.sh pre_postman_check.sh

# Verify structure
ls -la helios-rtb-engine/
```

### Step 3: Initial Build & Deployment

```bash
# Run automated setup
./setup.sh

# This will:
# 1. Build all Docker images
# 2. Start infrastructure (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL)
# 3. Deploy application services
# 4. Create Kafka topics
# 5. Seed sample data
# 6. Run health checks
```

**Expected Duration**: 5-10 minutes (first run)

### Step 4: Verification

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./test.sh

# Quick health check
./pre_postman_check.sh

# Check all containers
docker compose -f helios-rtb-engine/docker-compose.full.yml ps
```

**Success Criteria**: All services show "Up" or "Up (healthy)"

## Phase B: Understanding the System - "Exploration"

**Objective**: Learn how the system works by observing and testing it.

### Step 1: Explore the Data Flow
