<!-- ### Project Idea: Real-time, Context-Aware Ad Bidding Engine

This project simulates a core component of AdTech: a Real-Time Bidding (RTB) exchange. When a user visits a website, an ad auction happens in milliseconds. Your system will receive bid requests, enrich them with user data, decide which ad to show, and log the outcome. This is a high-throughput, low-latency problem.

**Why this is advanced:** This isn't a simple web app. It's a distributed data pipeline that must make complex decisions in under 100ms. It forces a focus on performance, caching, asynchronous processing, and stateful analytics.

**Core Services & Technology Stack:**

| Service | Programming Language | Database / Data Store | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bid Request Handler** | **Go** | (None - interfaces with Kafka) | A high-concurrency endpoint that receives incoming ad bid requests. It does initial validation and immediately publishes the request onto a Kafka topic for processing. Go is chosen here for its raw networking performance to handle massive request volumes. This is your "new language" service. |
| **User Profile Service** | **Node.js (TypeScript)** | **Redis** | A low-latency service that provides user data. Given a user ID from a bid request, it fetches a user profile (browsing history, interests) from a Redis cache to enable targeted advertising. It communicates via **gRPC** for maximum speed. |
| **Bidding Logic Service** | **Python (FastAPI)** | (None - in-memory logic) | Consumes bid requests from Kafka. It calls the User Profile Service (**gRPC**) to get context, then runs the core bidding logic (e.g., "for a user interested in 'hiking', bid $0.05 for this Nike ad"). It publishes its bid decision to another Kafka topic. |
| **Auction Service** | **Node.js (JavaScript)** | (None - real-time logic) | Consumes bids from multiple Bidding Logic instances, runs a quick "auction" (selects the highest bid), and determines the winner. The winning bid is sent back to the original requestor (simulated). |
| **Analytics & Reporting Service** | **Python (Django)** | **PostgreSQL / ClickHouse** | Asynchronously consumes auction result events from Kafka. It aggregates this data into a reporting database (like PostgreSQL or a specialized analytical DB like ClickHouse) and provides a **Next.js**-based dashboard for advertisers to see their campaign performance (impressions, spend, etc.). |

**Architectural Components & Communication:**

*   **Front-end:** A sophisticated **Next.js** dashboard for the **Analytics & Reporting Service**.
*   **Asynchronous Backbone:** **Kafka** is the core of the system, decoupling the high-speed ingestion from the enrichment, bidding, and analytics stages. This allows different parts of the system to scale independently.
*   **Low-Latency Synchronous Communication:** The critical path from the Bidding Logic to the User Profile Service uses **gRPC** for sub-millisecond data retrieval.
*   **API Gateway:** Manages and secures the entry point for the Bid Request Handler and the REST API for the Analytics dashboard.
*   **Polyglot Persistence:** You'll use Redis for its caching speed, and a powerful SQL or analytical database for complex reporting queries, perfectly demonstrating the "database per service" concept.
*   **Orchestration:** All services run in Docker containers managed by a Kubernetes cluster across your three laptops, simulating a distributed production environment.

# *Final Draft*

### **Project: "Helios" - A Real-Time Bidding (RTB) Engine**

#### 1. Project Vision & Goal

The goal of Project Helios is to design and build a distributed backend system that simulates a Demand-Side Platform (DSP) in the AdTech ecosystem. The system will receive ad placement opportunities (bid requests) in real-time, enrich these requests with user data, make an intelligent bidding decision in under 100 milliseconds, and log the results for analytics.

This project will demonstrate mastery of polyglot programming, diverse database usage, synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns, and cloud-native orchestration and monitoring, fulfilling all the advanced requirements of the assignment.

#### 2. Core Real-Time Bidding (RTB) Concepts

*   **Bid Request:** When a user visits a website with ad space, the ad exchange sends out a "bid request" to multiple DSPs. This request contains information about the ad slot, the website, and an anonymized user ID.
*   **Bid Response:** A DSP (our system) receives the request, decides if it wants to bid on this ad opportunity, and if so, how much. It sends back a "bid response" with the bid price and the ad creative to display.
*   **Auction:** The ad exchange runs a real-time auction, and the highest bidder wins.
*   **Impression:** The winning ad is shown to the user. Our system will receive a notification (a "win notification") if our bid was successful.

#### 3. High-Level System Architecture

The system is designed as an event-driven pipeline, prioritizing speed and scalability. The core data flow is asynchronous, built around Apache Kafka.

#### 4. Detailed Service Breakdown

Here is a detailed look at each microservice, its responsibilities, and technology choices.

| Service Name | Purpose | Primary Technology | Database / Data Store | Inbound Communication | Outbound Communication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Bid Request Handler** | To ingest a massive volume of incoming bid requests with minimal latency and place them on a message bus for processing. | **Go** | (Stateless) | HTTP/REST from API Gateway | Produces to Kafka Topic (`bid_requests`) |
| **2. Bidding Logic Service** | The core decision engine. It consumes requests, fetches user context, applies bidding rules/logic, and submits a bid. | **Python (FastAPI)** | (Stateless) | Consumes from Kafka Topic (`bid_requests`) | **gRPC** call to User Profile Service; Produces to Kafka Topic (`bid_responses`) |
| **3. User Profile Service** | Provides ultra-low-latency access to user profile data (interests, demographics) needed for targeted bidding. | **Node.js (TypeScript, Express)** | **Redis** | **gRPC** from Bidding Logic Service | **gRPC** response to Bidding Logic Service |
| **4. Auction Service (Simulator)** | Simulates the ad exchange's auction. It consumes bids and determines a winner, publishing the outcome. | **Node.js (JavaScript)** | (Stateless) | Consumes from Kafka Topic (`bid_responses`) | Produces to Kafka Topic (`auction_outcomes`) |
| **5. Analytics & Reporting Service**| Consumes auction outcomes, aggregates data for reporting, and exposes an API for a dashboard. | **Python (Django)** | **PostgreSQL** or **ClickHouse** | Consumes from Kafka Topic (`auction_outcomes`); REST API from Dashboard | Writes to its database. |
| **6. Advertiser Dashboard** | A web interface for advertisers to view campaign performance, spend, and other key metrics. | **Next.js (TypeScript)** | (Client-Side) | User interaction in browser | REST API calls to the Analytics Service |
| **7. Monitoring Stack** | To provide observability into the health and performance of the entire system. | **Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd, Jaeger** | Prometheus TSDB, Elasticsearch | Scrapes metrics endpoints; Receives logs | Displays data in Grafana/Kibana dashboards |

#### 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Infrastructure

*   **API Gateway:**
    *   **Technology:** **Traefik** or **Kong**. These are cloud-native gateways that integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **Single Entry Point:** All external traffic (bid requests, dashboard API calls) comes through the gateway.
        *   **Routing:** Directs incoming requests to the correct service (e.g., `/bid` -> `Bid Request Handler`, `/api/analytics` -> `Analytics Service`).
        *   **Security:** Terminates TLS, handles API key authentication for the bid endpoint, and JWT validation for the dashboard API.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Protects services from being overwhelmed.

*   **Communication Protocols:**
    *   **Asynchronous (Event-Driven Core):** **Apache Kafka** is the system's backbone. It provides a durable, ordered log of events, decoupling services and allowing them to be scaled, updated, and fail independently without data loss.
    *   **Synchronous (Low-Latency Request/Response):** **gRPC** is used for the critical, internal request from the `Bidding Logic Service` to the `User Profile Service`. This is chosen over REST because its use of HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers provides superior performance, which is essential for meeting the sub-100ms bidding deadline.
    *   **Synchronous (External API):** **REST/HTTP** is used for the external-facing APIs for simplicity and broad compatibility. The `Bid Request Handler` exposes a REST endpoint, and the `Analytics Service` provides a REST API for the Next.js frontend.

*   **Security Provisions:**
    *   **TLS Everywhere:** All communication will be encrypted using TLS. This includes external traffic to the API Gateway and, critically, all inter-service communication within the Kubernetes cluster (using a service mesh like Linkerd or Istio, or manual certificate management).
    *   **Authentication:** The dashboard will use JWT tokens for user sessions. The high-throughput bid endpoint will use a simpler API Key system for authentication.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Database credentials, API keys, and certificates will be managed securely using **Kubernetes Secrets**.

#### 6. Orchestration & Multi-Laptop Deployment

This is how the system will be physically run across your team's three laptops.

*   **Containerization:** Every single microservice will be packaged as a lightweight Docker image with its own `Dockerfile`.
*   **Kubernetes Cluster Setup:**
    1.  **Designate a Master Node:** One laptop will be designated as the Kubernetes master node. This node runs the K8s control plane (API server, scheduler, etc.).
    2.  **Designate Worker Nodes:** The other two laptops will be configured as worker nodes. They will join the cluster managed by the master.
    3.  **Tooling:** You can use tools like **k3s** or **kubeadm** to simplify the setup of a multi-node cluster on your local network.
*   **Deployment:**
    1.  **Kubernetes Manifests:** For each service, you will write YAML files defining `Deployment` (to manage pods), `Service` (to enable network communication), `ConfigMap` (for configuration), and `Secret` objects.
    2.  **Stateful Services:** Kafka and the databases will be deployed as `StatefulSets` in Kubernetes to ensure stable network identity and persistent storage.
    3.  **Applying Manifests:** Using `kubectl apply -f <directory>`, you will deploy the entire application stack to your cluster. Kubernetes will automatically schedule the pods (containers) to run across the available worker nodes.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** A library like **resilience4j** (Java), **Polly** (.NET), or an equivalent in Python/Node.js will be implemented in the `Bidding Logic Service`. If the `User Profile Service` is slow or down, the circuit breaker will trip, allowing the service to fail fast (e.g., by not bidding) instead of causing cascading failures.

#### 7. Monitoring & Logging Strategy

*   **Metrics (The Numbers):**
    *   **Prometheus:** An open-source monitoring system. Each microservice will expose a `/metrics` endpoint (using a client library) with key application metrics (e.g., `bids_processed_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`).
    *   Prometheus will be configured to automatically discover and scrape these endpoints within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Visualization (The Graphs):**
    *   **Grafana:** A visualization tool. You will connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source and build dashboards to monitor the health of the entire system in real-time.
*   **Logging (The Events):**
    *   **Structured Logging:** All services will log to `stdout` in a structured format (JSON).
    *   **Fluentd:** Deployed as a `DaemonSet` in Kubernetes, Fluentd will automatically collect these logs from all running containers on every node.
    *   **Elasticsearch & Kibana (EFK Stack):** Fluentd will forward the logs to Elasticsearch for indexing. Kibana will provide a powerful UI to search, filter, and analyze logs from all services in one place.
*   **Tracing (The Story of a Request):**
    *   **Jaeger or Zipkin:** You will integrate an OpenTelemetry or OpenTracing library into your services. This adds a unique trace ID to each incoming request, which is then passed along to downstream services. This allows you to visualize the entire lifecycle of a single bid request as it flows through Kafka, gRPC, and multiple services, making it easy to pinpoint bottlenecks.
