### The "Blast Radius" of the Change was Contained

The principle of **decoupling** is why you don't need to change anything else. The change was made in the direct communication link between two specific services:

1.  **`user-profile-service` (the gRPC Server)**
2.  **`bidding-logic-service` (the gRPC Client)**

Here is why other services were unaffected:

*   **Upstream Services:** The `bid-request-handler` is "upstream." It simply passes a message to Kafka and has no knowledge of the gRPC call that happens later. It is completely decoupled.
*   **Downstream Services:** The `auction-service` and `analytics-service` are "downstream." They consume messages from Kafka topics (`bid_responses` and `auction_outcomes`) that are produced by the `bidding-logic-service`. However, the structure of *those Kafka messages* does not contain the user profile. The `bidding-logic-service` uses the profile to make a decision and then produces a *new, separate message* containing only the bid outcome. This decoupling via Kafka is a core strength of this architecture, and it protected the downstream services from this change.
*   **UI / Frontend:** The `advertiser-dashboard` connects to the `analytics-service`, which is far downstream and completely insulated from the gRPC contract.

### Summary of Modifications

This table summarizes the changes you've correctly identified and approved.

| Prompt Number | Prompt Title | Reason for Modification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.2 (Revised)** | Develop the Node.js User Profile Service | The server code must now construct the new, richer, nested response object. |
| **2.3 (Revised)** | Implement a Data Seeding Script for Redis | The mock data generated must match the new, richer data structure for testing. |
| **2.5 (Revised)** | Integrate gRPC Client into Bidding Logic Service| The client code must now parse and log the new, nested response object. |
| **2.6 (Revised)** | Verification Plan for Phase 2 | The "expected output" in the test logs must be updated to match the new data structure. |
| **3.3 (Revised)** | Modify Bidding Logic Service to Produce Bids | The core bidding logic must be updated to **take advantage of** the new, richer data (especially the interest scores). |

You have successfully performed a targeted, architectural refactoring. The plan is now consistent and robust. You are clear to proceed with executing the revised prompts for Phase 2.
